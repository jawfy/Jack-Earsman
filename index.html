      <h1 style="">Hello.</h1>
      <p style="color:#646464;">I am a 13 year old boy who loves to code, coding is my life in reality I always am thinking about it, such as how to improve my latest projects. Coding is a big part if my family's life as my brother is very successfull in web development. but... there's always a problem when it comes to my parents, they don't really support web development as it involves me sitting on the computer almost 10 hours a day. This was the same for my brother, I mean we all have to live with it some how our parents just love us and want the best. I started developing around 1 year ago now and have enjoyed every minuet of it. Web development is inspiaring as you can use your amagination and creativity to make it look however you want! The best part is when your website is done, it truley is amazing! </p>

      <p style="color:#646464;"> My latest project is currently, <B>DeathDrops | 1.8 | Player Drops | Mob Drops</B>. DeathDrops is a spigot plugin which let's players kill mobs/players and recive a customized item rather than the usuall drop on there death. The plugin is currently under heavy development and there is a lot of bright ideas for the future to be added, currently I am working on adding a configiration to configure the death drops, I am running into some issues though. </p>
