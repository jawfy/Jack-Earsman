          <h4 style="padding: 40px; background-color: #111;">Insperation</h4>
          <p style="padding: 40px; background-color: #111;">My brother is a designer &amp; website developer which is where I got the inspiration... I was 9 when I started to bug my brother, I'd come sit in his bedroom constantly asking questions and watching what he was doing. I believe that that day is what first sparked design in my head, I can remember one day I came into his room and he was on photoshop cs5 designing a communication type icon, it had two ellipse objects with a little arrow at the bottom right-hand side of each, he spent hours if not days perfecting the design to eventually see it appear in the footer of his and his partners app called; interstateapp.</p>

          <br>

          <h4 style="padding: 40px; background-color: #111;">Learning</h4>
          <p style="padding: 40px; background-color: #111;">This amazed me to see something come from what was built by my brother to appear on an interactive website! It attracted me to design rather than HTML but I always wanted to explore it yet it took me 3 years from 9 to finally try website development. In that 3 years, I focused on photoshop and design, I spent hours each day messing around with tools, watching online tutorials and reading articles to eventually get to grips with how design and photoshop worked.</p>

          <br>

          <h4 style="padding: 40px; background-color: #111;">Website Development</h4>
          <p style="padding: 40px; background-color: #111;">12, almost knowing everything about photoshop and what a good design looks like I took to website development. I took the same approach that I did with design only I would download templates and mess around with the code rather than tools. It took about a year of this when I felt confident with HTML and CSS.</p>

          <br>

          <h4 style="padding: 40px; background-color: #111;">Present Day</h4>
          <p style="padding: 40px; background-color: #111;">I am now a designer born and brought up in Scotland. I'm now 14 years of age teaching myself new things every day. I'm now looking forward to continuing my career onto University in a couple of years to eventually get a job.</p>
