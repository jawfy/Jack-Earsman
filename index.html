                    <p style="color:#D5D5D5; font-size:18px">Hello, I am a 13 year old developer named Jack Earsman hense the website name, anyway... I am here to give you a little big of knowledge on my background who I am and what I do. I first started developing websites, but... it was really just a binch of words that meant nothing to me, this was because I was around the age of 10 when my brother decided to give me a few lessons on web development, to tell the truth I wasn't really intrested in it at that point. As I grew older I started to take online development courses, watch youtube vieos till my eyes would shut and a few lessons from my brother when ever he had the time or when he was home. I was really intressted in becoming a website developer at that moment in time and still am as I would like to mkae my bother proud as I look up to him as a insperation because if he wasn't around I would not be doing this today. I am really enjoying all diffrent types of languafes at this moment in time and proceed to learning more. I currently am stuggling with time to learn as I have my exams to study for to get into classes for my highers ect and not to mention my parents don't support the idea of developing at all... but I guess we all have that in our lifes, they just want the best for us.</p>

                    <p style="color:#D5D5D5; font-size:18px">Now some of you may be wanting to ask what types of things do I develop, well... I currently am working on this website as well as a few custom and public spigot/bukkit plugins. Truthfully web development is my faviroute and what I would love to do when I grow older. The current public plugin I am working on it DeathDrops a plugin where there a customized drops rather than the default minecraft drops. It consists of player drops and mob drops. My website that you are currently tabbed on is the most recent activity of mine as I am working really hard to produce a clean, viewer friendly website, this is the kind of design I have been wanting to achive for a while now but just didn't have the knowledge to do so. Now I do! Hope to see future updates to the site along with some tutorials.</p>
